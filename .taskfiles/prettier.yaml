    cmds:
      # prettier's sql formatting breaks sqlc because prettier wants to put spaces between a
      # word and an open paren, like this: `where (...)`. this is problematic for sqlc named
      # args because they're formatted as `sqlc.arg(...)`, which results in prettier outputting
      # `sqlc.arg (...)`. this causes sqlc to blow up because of the space between arg and (
      - find . -type f -name "*.sql" -exec sed -i'' -E 's/(sqlc\.[[:alnum:]]+) \(/\1(/g' {} \;
